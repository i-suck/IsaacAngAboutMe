            <p>I started coding when I was about 8 years old. I self taught myself through youtube videos and coding courses. I want to work in the computer science industry, either game design or back-end development. I am the most proficient in these fields because I have designed multiple games on roblox and I know my way around python</p>

            <p>Every kid loves playing roblox but I always wondered, “How were they made?”. Games couldn’t have just appeared out of thin air someone had to have made them. So my curiosity led me to downloading roblox studio. I tried making my own game, trying to replicate the front page games. Although they were terrible, I had fun. But I wanted to learn more, how to monetize my game. So I looked on youtube and went down the rabbit hole of endless tutorials. I took all the little things from the vast videos and mushed them together into one game. Sadly, I had to end this <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/15304036927/Huiji">project</a> as I did not have the time to continue it. But this experience opened the door to endless possibilities. Front-end, back-end, machine learning, and much more. I plan to learn it all in my next years of my life</p>
